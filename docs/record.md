# record — desktop and window capture

`record` is an optional native tool for SDK and tool developers. It captures PNG screenshots and H.264/MP4 recordings from the desktop or a visible application window. Default full builds do not compile or register it.

| Platform | Support |
| --- | --- |
| Windows amd64 | Supported |
| Linux amd64/arm64 with X11 | Supported |
| Wayland, macOS, Windows arm64 | Not supported |
| Headless hosts and Windows session 0 | Not supported |

Examples:

```json
{"action":"screenshot"}
{"action":"screenshot","target":"window","pid":1234}
{"action":"record","target":"window","window_handle":"0x12345","duration_seconds":10}
{"action":"start","target":"desktop","fps":30}
{"action":"stop","recording_id":"<id>"}
{"action":"status"}
```

Windows window targets use an `HWND`; Linux uses an X11 Window ID. Handles are strings and accept decimal or `0x` hexadecimal notation. A PID resolves to the largest visible, non-minimized top-level window owned by that process.

Defaults:

- Desktop target, 30 FPS, mouse cursor included.
- Screenshots are PNG; recordings are H.264/libx264 in MP4.
- Outputs are written below `.cyber/record/` unless `output` is specified.
- At most four recordings run concurrently. Set `CYBER_RECORD_MAX_CONCURRENT` to a value from 1 to 16 to change the limit.

Media transport uses the existing AOP media and file namespaces. Screenshot
previews are returned as bounded inline `Content.media` data. Completed videos
are returned as `Content.media` with a task-relative `Resource.uri`; consumers
read the underlying MP4 through chunked `aop.file` requests. When a tool
invocation supplies a work directory, the default output is
`<workdir>/.cyber/record/`, so remote runners can expose the URI without
leaking or depending on a machine-global data path.

Limitations:

- Video only; microphone and system audio are not captured.
- Wayland is not supported. Use an X11 session.
- macOS and Windows arm64 do not have a native recorder backend.
- Capture requires an interactive graphical session; headless hosts and Windows session 0 are not supported.
- The window must be visible and non-minimized. Capture size is fixed when recording starts; closing, minimizing, or shrinking the window can terminate the recording.
- The native backend is not present in official full builds. Custom builds require CGO, the `record` build tag, and a supported C toolchain.

Record-enabled builds statically link a feature-minimal FFmpeg, x264, and the
Linux XCB client code, so users do not install those runtimes separately. This
is single-file distribution, not literally zero runtime dependencies: Windows
still uses system DLLs, while Linux requires glibc and an accessible X11
`DISPLAY`. The SDK only enables the platform capture input, its raw/BMP
decoder, libx264, the MP4 muxer, file output, and pixel conversion. It is not a
general-purpose FFmpeg build.

## Build tags and CGO

The record build adds the `record` tag to the full feature set and requires
`CGO_ENABLED=1`. It composes `exts/record`, which owns the native runtime and
registers the capture Tool. Build tags and the CGO setting come from
[editions.env](../editions.env); use `make record` to apply the complete set.
Other distribution builds and custom minimal entry points are documented in
the [build guide](../README.md#build-and-embed).

## Native SDKs

The recorder's FFmpeg/x264 backend links a prebuilt static SDK that this
repository downloads and verifies but never builds. It is published as a
`chainreactors/native` release asset:

| SDK | Target | Version pin | Release tag |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Recorder | `record` | `RECORD_NATIVE_VERSION` | `RECORD_NATIVE_RELEASE` |

`.github/native/versions.env` pins the tag, and `.github/native/sdk.sh fetch
record [os] [arch]` downloads the archive, checks its SHA-256 sidecar and
`.versions` manifest, and unpacks it into `.cache/native/record/<os>_<arch>`.
`sdk.sh env record` prints the link environment for that prefix.

The archive carries one `librecord.a` plus its narrow ABI header. It already
combines the record shim, FFmpeg, x264, and Linux XCB objects; the cyber build
consumes neither FFmpeg headers nor pkg-config metadata. Install it through the
Makefile, which wires its library prefix in:

```bash
make record-native   # .cache/native/record/<os>_<arch>, for `record`
make record          # fetches it, then builds bin/aiscan-record
```

`make record` depends on the fetch target, so it needs no manual pre-step.
Building the record edition by hand means exporting
`CGO_LDFLAGS="-L<cache>/lib"` yourself, because a cgo directive can only expand
`${SRCDIR}` and the archive is outside the module.

The recorder SDK supports Linux amd64/arm64 and Windows amd64. `make record`
therefore fails on macOS, and on Windows it needs MinGW-w64 so that `gcc` can
link the MSVC-incompatible static archive.

`RECORD_ARCH` picks the SDK architecture, `CYBER_RECORD_PREFIX` overrides the
cache directory, and `CYBER_NATIVE_URL` points downloads at a mirror.

## Validation

Native smoke tests are opt-in because they require an interactive desktop/X11 session:

```bash
go test -tags "record record_integration" ./exts/record
```

## WebUI results

The conversation displays `record` tool results: screenshot previews with an
original-image download, completed MP4 playback/download, recording status,
and capture errors. History replay uses the same typed AOP results. The WebUI
does not add capture controls.

URI resources are served through
`GET /api/sessions/{sessionID}/media/{eventID}/{outputIndex}`. The server resolves
the persisted result and its assigned node, then reads the resource using
bounded `aop.file` requests. HTTP Range supports video seeking; `?download=1`
downloads the original file. Remote files require the assigned node to remain
connected.

Frontend setup, record/media browser checks and related Go transport checks are
documented in the [Web frontend test guide](../web/frontend/e2e/README.md).
